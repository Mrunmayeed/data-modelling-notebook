# Audiobook-Data-Modelling

This is a basic data cleanup and DL modelling notebook. 

The dataset is an audiobook data, where we have metadata about different audiobooks, like how many minutes it was listened to and by how many users.
Based on this, we predict whether the book will be subscribed (we have a train set with this value given).

This is a very basic dataset with no description of features provided besides the fact that last column is the label
