# data-modelling-notebook
This is a basic data cleanup and DL modelling notebook. 
The dataset is an audiobook data, where we have metadata about different audiobooks, like how many minutes it was listened to and by how many users.
Based on this, we predict whether the book will be subscribed (we have a train set with this value given).
